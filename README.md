# Claude Toolkit

A collection of reusable skills, agents, commands, hooks, and settings for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code).

Everything here is designed to be copied into your own `~/.claude/` or project `./.claude/` directory so Claude Code can use it.

---

## What is a skill?

If you're new to Claude Code, here's the one-minute version.

A **skill** is a folder with a `SKILL.md` file inside it. That file contains instructions written _for Claude_ — not for you. When Claude Code is running and detects that your request matches a skill (either by name, trigger phrase, or topic), it loads that skill's instructions into context and follows them.

Skills live in one of two places:

- `~/.claude/skills/<name>/` — **global**, available in every project
- `<your-project>/.claude/skills/<name>/` — **per-project**, only available when Claude is working in that directory

You don't _run_ a skill the way you run a script. You either:

1. **Describe what you want in plain English** — _"mock up a new pricing page"_ — and Claude auto-invokes the matching skill, or
2. **Name the skill explicitly** — _"use the ux-mockup skill to..."_ — when you want to force a specific one, or
3. **Use a slash command** — some skills expose themselves as `/skill-name` (e.g. `/handoff`, `/insight-harness`). Type `/` in Claude Code to see what's available.

After installing a skill, verify it's there by running `ls ~/.claude/skills` (for global) or `ls .claude/skills` (for project-local). Claude Code also loads skills at session start, so restart your conversation if you just installed one.

## Quick install

Clone the repo and use the installer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/craigdossantos/claude-toolkit.git
cd claude-toolkit

./install.sh                                   # interactive menu
./install.sh --all                             # install everything into ./.claude
./install.sh --global --all                    # install everything into ~/.claude
./install.sh --skills ux-mockup qa-checklist   # install specific skills only
./install.sh --list                            # see what's available
```

The installer **copies files** into your target directory — it doesn't symlink, doesn't download anything else, and doesn't touch files outside the target. Read it before running if you want: [`install.sh`](./install.sh). To uninstall, delete the skill's directory under `.claude/skills/`.

### One-line install for insight-harness only

If you just want to try [`insight-harness`](./skills/insight-harness/README.md) without cloning:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/insight-harness/scripts && \
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/craigdossantos/claude-toolkit/main/skills/insight-harness/SKILL.md \
  -o ~/.claude/skills/insight-harness/SKILL.md && \
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/craigdossantos/claude-toolkit/main/skills/insight-harness/scripts/extract.py \
  -o ~/.claude/skills/insight-harness/scripts/extract.py && \
open "$(python3 ~/.claude/skills/insight-harness/scripts/extract.py)"
```

## Platform support

This toolkit was built on macOS. Everything works on **macOS** and **Linux** out of the box. **Windows** works too, but a stock Windows machine (PowerShell/CMD only) is missing every dependency — `install.sh` and `statusline.sh` are bash scripts and won't run in PowerShell directly.

### Windows setup

Run the toolkit from **WSL** or **Git Bash** — not native PowerShell. Git Bash is _not_ a Windows default; it ships with [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/), a separate install.

A fresh Windows box needs the following. Install the core tier first; the rest as projects require them.

**Core — required for the toolkit to function:**

| Install                                 | Why                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/) | Provides `git` **and Git Bash** — the bash interpreter that runs `.sh` scripts. Bundles `awk`, `sed`, `date`. |
| [Node.js (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/)    | Runtime for Claude Code, plus `npx tsc` / `npx eslint` / `prettier` used by hooks.                            |
| Claude Code                             | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`                                                                    |
| [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)     | Runs the hook scripts under `hooks/`. Check "Add Python to PATH" during install.                              |
| `jq`                                    | Used by `statusline.sh`. Install with `winget install jqlang.jq` — not bundled with Git for Windows.          |

Run `statusline.sh` via Git Bash. Native PowerShell cannot execute a bare `.sh` file.

**Custom binaries — only if you use the hook presets in `settings/`:**

Some hook presets call external tools (`dcg`, `rtk`) that are _not_ vendored in this repo and have no Windows builds here. If you adopt those presets on Windows, either supply Windows builds of those tools or remove the hook entries that reference them — otherwise affected tool calls will error.

**Partner CLIs — optional, install per project:**

`gh`, `supabase`, `vercel`, `railway`, `wrangler`, `stripe`, `inngest` — each has a Windows installer or `winget`/`npm` package.

## Directory structure

```
claude-toolkit/
├── install.sh          # Installer script
├── README.md           # You are here
├── skills/             # Claude Code skills (each with SKILL.md + README.md)
├── agents/             # Subagent definitions

```

Each skill folder contains:

- **`SKILL.md`** — the instructions Claude reads when the skill is invoked. Written for Claude, not for humans.
- **`README.md`** — the human-facing docs (what you're reading now is the repo-level one). Every skill has its own.
- **`assets/`** — screenshots, template HTML, or other static files the skill references.
- **`scripts/`** — helper scripts for skills that shell out (e.g. `video-course-site`, `insight-harness`).

---

## Adding your own skill

1. Create a directory under `skills/` with a `SKILL.md` using YAML frontmatter:

   ```markdown
   ---
   name: my-skill
   description: "What it does. When Claude should invoke it. Include trigger phrases."
   ---

   # My Skill

   Instructions Claude will follow when this skill is invoked...
   ```

2. (Recommended) Add a `README.md` alongside it for humans, following the pattern used by the skills listed above — hero image, "Use this when...", "What you say to Claude", "Install", "What you'll see".

3. Run `./install.sh --list` to verify your skill is detected, then `./install.sh --skills my-skill` to install it locally.

4. Open a PR.
